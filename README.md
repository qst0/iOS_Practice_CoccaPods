# iOS_Practice_CoccaPods
Learning iOS, Xcode and Swift with an app a day (Day 4)

Inspired and guided by the tutorial at:

https://www.raywenderlich.com/156971/cocoapods-tutorial-swift-getting-started

Focusing much more on **Cracking The Coding Interview** today,

But I wanted to make sure to finish something for my iOS practice!

This seemed like a great pick to line me up for a messaging app tomorrow.

I learned quite a bit from this tutorial, although the project was set up mostly already...

It's cool to see how others teach and make tutorials.

Let alone how they organize their projects and thoughts in Xcode!

This tutorial shouldn't take more than a half an hour, so do it today!

Learning about CoocaPods seems like a great way to get your hands on Dynamic Libraries!

Tomorrow's tutorial / app should be:

Which should be a bit more substantial!

As of now (Sept 6th 2017) day 1 and day 2 of my app-a-day challange are not posted

But be sure to check out day 3 [here](https://github.com/qst0/iOS_Practice_Flag_Game)!
